            <p>Intelligent robotic systems is a growing field that has received in recent years tremendous attention  and support from government and industry. Robots now have the potential to move beyond traditional manufacturing setting into human-centered environments. Mobile robots, including humanoids, drones, animal-shaped robots  and ground mobile robots can perform a variety of operations that manned  systems struggle with, and their use brings significant economic savings and environmental benefits whilst reducing the risk to human life. Mobile robot-based service and product innovation, as driven by increased levels of connectivity and automation, is limited by the growing dependence on poorly interoperable proprietary technologies and the risks posed to people, to other vehicles and to property. Actions creating globally harmonized, commercially exploitable yet widely accessible R&D ecosystems should be publicly performed.</p>
            <p>The Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Laboratory (IAR Lab) complements current efforts with a particular focus on safe software and hardware mobile robot architectures. IAR Lab will bear a holistically designed ecosystem ranging from application to electronic components, realized as a tightly integrated multi-vendor and compositional drone embedded architecture solution and a tool chain complementing the compositional architecture principles. The ecosystem aims at supporting (1) efficient customization and incremental assurance of drone embedded platforms, (2) safe autonomous decision making concerning individual or cooperative missions, (3) trustworthy drone-to-drone and drone-to ground communications even in presence of malicious attackers and under the intrinsic platform constraints, and (4) agile mand cost-effective compositional design and assurance of drone modules and systems.. Lead applications driving ecosystem development and benchmarking on the fields of transport, inspection, logistic, precision agriculture, parcel delivery, social applications, etc. will be also pursued.</p>
